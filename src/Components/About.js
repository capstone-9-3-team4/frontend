            <p className="box-border h-32">I decided to  jump and build my wings on the way down on this new career path after 24 years in municipal government specializing in technology and administration. Also, as a certified speaker, trainer and life coach with the Maxwell Leadership Team because personal growth and development is also a passion of mine, I want to utilize my professional experience, certifications, and education through Pursuit, to excel as a distinguished Hispanic leader in the technology sector as a Full Stack Web Developer. I also want  to drive innovation and foster growth among fellow Hispanic women and elevate the representation and success of underrepresented individuals in the technology field.</p>

            <p className="box-border h-32">In the past year I’ve embarked on a journey of personal and professional growth.  My previous work experiences include manual labor, music retail, and audio engineering.
            My background in audio engineering has equipped me with a keen understanding of the organization and intricacies of signal flow, which I’ve found to be highly relevant in software development. When I am not coding my interests and passions include physical fitness and music production, and my long-term goal is to be able to utilize my newly developed programming skills and apply them to my interests and passions.
